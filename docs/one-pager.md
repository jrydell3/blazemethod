# BLAZE: The One-Liner and The Slide

## The One-Liner

**"BLAZE is Guide, Gate, Guard — it helps you build, checks before you ship, and watches while it runs."**

Or even simpler:

**"We don't vibe code. We BLAZE."**

---

## The Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

"BLAZE is three things: a Guide that helps you while you build, a Gate that automatically checks your code before it ships, and a Guard that watches production. Same speed as vibe coding, but it actually works tomorrow. Everyone can build — developers, internal teams, even customers — but everything is safe and tracked. We don't vibe code. We BLAZE."

## What To Say With The Slide

"Starting now, we're using BLAZE for all new development.

Three words to remember: Guide, Gate, Guard.

**Guide** helps you while you code. Ask it anything. It knows our patterns, our rules, how we do things. Just say 'help' and it helps.

**Gate** checks your code automatically before it ships. Security, tests, our standards. If it passes, you ship. If it fails, it tells you why.

**Guard** watches production. When something breaks, it catches it — often before users notice.

That's it. You'll learn more as you use it. The Guide teaches you everything else.

One more thing: this isn't about slowing down. It's about going faster without breaking things. Same speed as vibe coding, but reliable.

We don't vibe code. We BLAZE."

## The Three Things People Will Remember

1. **Guide** — helps you build
2. **Gate** — checks before ship  
3. **Guard** — watches production

That's BLAZE.
