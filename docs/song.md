## A Country Song About Building Software the Right Way

**Duration:** Under 2 minutes

### VERSE 1
Well I used to code alone in the dark
Prayin' my deploy wouldn't miss the mark
Ship it fast and cross my fingers tight
Hope to God it works on Friday night

### CHORUS
Now I got a Guide right by my side
A Gate that checks before I ride
A Guard that watches through the night
We don't vibe code, we BLAZE it right!

### VERSE 2
Used to call it "vibe code," ship and pray
Fix the bugs tomorrow, that's the way
But tomorrow came with fires to fight
Three AM alerts, another sleepless night

### CHORUS
Now I got a Guide right by my side
A Gate that checks before I ride
A Guard that watches through the night
We don't vibe code, we BLAZE it right!

### BRIDGE
Three words, that's all you gotta know
Guide, Gate, Guard — let your fire grow
Build it fast but build it true
BLAZE is here for me and you

### FINAL CHORUS (bigger, triumphant)
So light it up and let it fly
No more crossin' fingers, wonderin' why
Sleep well tonight, the Guard's on sight
We don't vibe code... we BLAZE it right!

### OUTRO (spoken, over fading music)
🔥 Guide. Gate. Guard. That's BLAZE, y'all. 🔥

## Notes for Suno:

**Key phrases that MUST be clear:**
- "Guide" "Gate" "Guard" (the three pillars)
- "We don't vibe code, we BLAZE it right" (the manifesto)
- "Three words, that's all you gotta know"

**Vibe check:**
- Should feel like a song you'd hear at a tech conference that makes everyone smile
- Self-aware that it's cheesy — that's the point
- Catchy enough that "Guide, Gate, Guard" sticks in your head
- Approachable, not intimidating

**Instruments:**
- Acoustic guitar (prominent)
- Light drums/percussion
- Maybe a little pedal steel for that country feel
- Keep it simple and warm

*"Because BLAZE should be approachable and fun, not scary."*
