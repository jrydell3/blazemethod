# 🔥 The Blaze Method

> **Build fast. Ship safe. Sleep well.**

The Blaze Method is a free, open-source methodology for safely shipping AI-generated code. Created on January 25, 2026 by [John Rydell](https://linkedin.com/in/johnrrydell) and his son Otto Rydell.

**For humans who want to thrive alongside AI, not be replaced by it.**

## What Is BLAZE?

We don't vibe code. We BLAZE.

The Blaze Method addresses the "vibe coding" problem where AI-generated code works initially but fails in production. It provides the same speed as vibe coding but with actual reliability.

### The Three Pillars

1. **🧭 GUIDE** — Helps while you build
   An AI assistant that knows your team's patterns, rules, and preferences. Ask it anything while coding.

2. **🚪 GATE** — Checks before you ship
   Automated security scans, tests, and compliance checks. Same rules for everyone. Pass and you ship.

3. **👁️ GUARD** — Watches production
   Monitoring and alerts that catch issues before users notice. Sleep well knowing Guard is watching.

## Why BLAZE?

### The Problem

- 71% of workers fear AI job displacement
- 96% of developers don't fully trust AI-generated code
- 45% of AI-generated code contains security vulnerabilities
- Developer burnout is at all-time highs

### The Solution

**BLAZE doesn't replace people. It frees them.**

The best developers spend too much time on process. BLAZE automates the burden (security scans, compliance, monitoring) so humans can focus on the work that only humans can do: creativity, judgment, architecture, solving problems that matter.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to start is with Guide:

```bash
npx @blazemethod/guide init
```

Guide connects to your AI coding assistant (Claude, Cursor, etc.) and starts helping immediately. No configuration needed.

## Philosophy

> "What we free up — time, talent, treasure — we give back."

This isn't about putting people out of work. It's about helping good developers flourish. The best developers become "orchestrators" who guide AI tools effectively.

### Vibe Coding vs. BLAZE

| Vibe Coding | BLAZE |
|-------------|-------|
| "It works on my machine" | "It works everywhere" |
| "I think it's secure?" | "It passed Gate" |
| "Don't touch that code" | "Anyone can improve it" |
| Fast, then chaos | Fast, then faster |

## Origin Story

**Christmas Eve, 2024:** Otto Rydell taught his father John about "vibe coding" — the new wave of AI-assisted development.

**January 25, 2026:** After weeks of building with AI tools and seeing both the speed and the chaos, John and Otto created The Blaze Method.

**Not just for their companies. For everyone.**
